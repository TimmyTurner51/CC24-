I'll try editing main.c to hopefully work.

The gfx folder in the src folder does not work as far as I can tell. I just borrowed files from the tileset and tilemap examples in the GraphX Library here:
https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/wiki/GraphX-Library:-Creating-Tilemaps




Original main.c code:

// my_function(1,2,"hi");
// What does my_function return? What arguments does it take?
// It can make a guess, but it likely won't be correct.
// Here, you tell it with the prototype, "my_function doesn't return anything",
// it takes two integers and a string as arguments.
// If you don't make prototypes, you definition must be before where you use it.
