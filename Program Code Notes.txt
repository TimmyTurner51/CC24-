We might delete this file later, but I think we could use these lines of code in main.c:

#include <graphx.h>
#include <keypadc.h>

...and...

gfx_Begin();

   and we could possibly use
gfx_PrintStringXY("Text here... ", 1, 1);
    ...for basic text output to the screen.
    
    
We can both edit this at anytime to better communicate our code ideas here and our story and other stuff in the backstory.txt...
